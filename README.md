# Number generator and checker
## How does it work?
It's simple. You need to run `Number generator.exe`. It will output a file called `numbers.txt`.  
Then you need to run `Numero Verifier.exe` and it will output a file called `output.txt` containing **number: phone operator**. If it does not show you a telephone operator, it means that the number generated is invalid.
